    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "How does DBSCAN clustering handle noise in the data?",
    "answer": "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) handles noise in the data by considering points with fewer than a minimum number of neighbors as noise and assigning them to a separate cluster."

    "question": "What is the key difference between PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction?",
    "answer": "The key difference between PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is that PCA is a linear method that preserves the global structure of the data, while t-SNE is a non-linear method that preserves the local structure of the data."

    "question": "How would you evaluate the performance of a clustering model?",
    "answer": "To evaluate the performance of a clustering model, you can use metrics such as silhouette score, calinski-harabasz index, and davies-bouldin index, which measure the separation and cohesion of the clusters."

    "question": "Suppose you have a dataset with a mix of continuous and categorical features. Which clustering algorithm would you use, and why?",
    "answer": "I would use hierarchical clustering for this dataset. Hierarchical clustering can handle both continuous and categorical features and can be used to visualize the dendrogram of the clusters."

    "question": "Explain how to detect anomalies in a dataset using one-class SVM. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?",
    "answer": "One-class SVM works by finding a decision boundary that maximizes the margin between the inliers and the anomalous data points. Advantages include handling high-dimensional data and being robust to outliers. However, it can be sensitive to the choice of parameters and may not perform well on datasets with varying densities."

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "question": "Describe a scenario where using k-means clustering would not be suitable, and suggest an alternative clustering algorithm that would be more effective.",
    "answer": "K-means clustering assumes that the data is normally distributed and the clusters are spherical. However, if the data has varying densities or non-linear structures, k-means may not be effective. In such cases, using DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) would be more suitable, as it can handle varying densities and non-linear structures."

    "answer": "To apply PCA, I would first standardize the data using mean normalization and then calculate the covariance matrix. I would then compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix and select the top k eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. The benefits of this approach include reducing the dimensionality of the data, preserving most of the variance, and making the data more interpretable."

    "question": "Explain how to use hierarchical clustering to identify clusters in a dataset, and describe the trade-offs between agglomerative and divisive clustering.",
    "answer": "Hierarchical clustering works by building a dendrogram that represents the hierarchical structure of the data. Agglomerative clustering starts with individual data points and merges them into clusters, while divisive clustering starts with a single cluster and splits it into smaller clusters. The trade-offs between the two approaches include agglomerative clustering being more computationally efficient but potentially less accurate, while divisive clustering can be more accurate but computationally expensive."

    "answer": "To apply k-NN imputation, I would select the k nearest neighbors for each data point with missing values and use their values as the imputed values. The benefits of this approach include being able to handle non-linear relationships and handling missing values without assuming a specific distribution. However, the limitations include requiring a good choice of k and being sensitive to noisy data."
