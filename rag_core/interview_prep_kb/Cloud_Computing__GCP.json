    "question": "Explain the differences between using a GCP load balancer and an Ingress resource in a Kubernetes cluster.",
    "answer": "A GCP load balancer is a traditional load balancer that distributes traffic across multiple instances, whereas an Ingress resource is a Kubernetes concept that manages incoming HTTP requests and routes them to a specific service. While both can be used for load balancing, an Ingress resource is more flexible and can be used for routing and SSL termination."

    "question": "You have a GCP project with a large dataset stored in Cloud Storage. How would you implement a data pipeline using Cloud Functions and Cloud Pub/Sub to trigger a data processing workflow when new files are added to the bucket?",
    "answer": "You would create a Cloud Function that listens for new files in the bucket using the Cloud Storage Pub/Sub trigger. When a new file is added, the function would publish a message to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. A Cloud Function subscribed to this topic would then be triggered to perform the data processing workflow."

    "question": "What are the main differences between using a GCP Persistent Disk and a GCP Local SSD as a boot disk for a Compute Engine instance?",
    "answer": "A GCP Persistent Disk is a block-level storage device that can be attached to an instance as a boot disk, whereas a GCP Local SSD is a high-performance storage device that is directly attached to the instance's local SSD. While both can be used as boot disks, Local SSDs are more expensive but offer better performance, and Persistent Disks are more cost-effective but may have higher latency."

    "question": "How would you implement a CI/CD pipeline for a GCP-based application using Cloud Build and Cloud Deploy?",
    "answer": "You would create a Cloud Build trigger that listens for changes to your application code and triggers a build process when changes are detected. The build process would produce a container image, which would then be deployed to Cloud Run or App Engine using Cloud Deploy. Cloud Deploy would manage the rollout of the new image to production and can be configured to handle canary releases or blue-green deployments."

    "question": "Explain how to use GCP's AutoML service to automate the process of training a machine learning model.",
    "answer": "To use AutoML, you would first create a dataset in BigQuery or upload a CSV file to Cloud Storage. You would then create an AutoML dataset and specify the type of model you want to train (e.g., classification, regression). AutoML would automatically select the best algorithm and hyperparameters for the model, train it on your dataset, and provide a trained model that you can use for predictions."
