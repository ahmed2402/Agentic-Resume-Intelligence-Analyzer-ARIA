    "question": "How can you make interactive elements (such as buttons and links) more accessible?",
    "answer": "To make interactive elements more accessible, ensure that they have sufficient color contrast, are not too small or too close together, and provide a clear and consistent visual indication of their state (e.g., hover, focus, active)."

    "question": "What is the difference between a link and a button in terms of accessibility?",
    "answer": "A link should be used for navigation, while a button should be used for actions. In terms of accessibility, buttons typically have a clearer and more consistent visual indication of their state (e.g., hover, focus, active), whereas links rely on the underline and color change to indicate their state."

    "question": "How would you approach designing an accessible mobile app for users with cognitive disabilities, such as autism or dementia?",
    "answer": "I would focus on creating a consistent and predictable user experience, using clear and simple language, and providing visual and auditory cues to help users understand the app's functionality. I would also consider using a simplified navigation menu, and providing a 'reset' or 'restart' feature to help users who become overwhelmed."

    "answer": "Common pitfalls to avoid include using colors that are too similar, and failing to provide sufficient contrast between colors. To ensure accessibility, I would use the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 color contrast ratio, and test the color scheme with colorblind simulators to ensure that it is accessible for users with visual impairments."

    "answer": "I would provide closed captions for all videos, and ensure that the captions are accurate and synchronized with the audio. I would also provide an option to display audio descriptions, and consider using sign language interpretation for videos that require it. Additionally, I would provide a 'transcript' or 'text summary' feature to allow users to read the content of the video."
