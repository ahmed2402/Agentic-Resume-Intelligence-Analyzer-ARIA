    "question": "Can you explain the difference between a modal window and a popup? When would you use each?",
    "answer": "A modal window is a self-contained window that overlays the main content, while a popup is a small window that appears on top of the main content. I would use a modal window for critical or time-sensitive information, such as confirmations or alerts. A popup is better suited for less critical information, such as notifications or reminders."

    "question": "Design a loading animation for a data-intensive web application. What principles would you follow, and what animation would you propose?",
    "answer": "To design a loading animation for a data-intensive web application, I would follow the principles of rhythm, repetition, and progression. I would propose a animation that uses a combination of spinning circles and morphing shapes to create a sense of movement and fluidity. The animation would transition from a static state to a dynamic state, indicating the progress of data loading."

    "question": "What are some best practices for designing accessible interactions, such as keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility?",
    "answer": "To design accessible interactions, I would follow best practices such as providing keyboard-navigable elements, using ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility, and ensuring that all interactive elements have a clear and consistent focus state. Additionally, I would test the interaction with various screen readers and keyboard layouts to ensure that it works as intended."

    "question": "Design an adaptive navigation system for a dynamic website that adjusts its layout based on the user's screen size and device type. How would you ensure a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes?",
    "answer": "To create an adaptive navigation system, I would use a combination of responsive design principles, mobile-first approach, and flexible grid systems. I would also employ media queries to apply different styles based on the screen size and device type. Additionally, I would use A/B testing and user feedback to refine the navigation system and ensure a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes."
