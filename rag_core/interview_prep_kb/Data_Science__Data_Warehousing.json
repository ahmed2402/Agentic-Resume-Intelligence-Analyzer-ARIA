    "question": "What is the difference between a Star Schema and a Snowflake Schema?",
    "answer": "A Star Schema is a type of dimensional modeling where fact tables are surrounded by a single set of dimension tables. A Snowflake Schema is a variation of Star Schema where each dimension table is further divided into multiple levels, each containing more granular data."

    "question": "Design a star schema for an e-commerce database, assuming the following dimensions: customer, order, product, and time. Describe the fact table and its relationships with the dimension tables.",
    "answer": "The star schema would consist of a fact table 'order_fact' with the following columns: order_id, customer_id, product_id, order_date, quantity, and revenue. The dimension tables would be: 'customer_dim' with columns customer_id, name, email; 'order_dim' with columns order_id, order_date, status; 'product_dim' with columns product_id, name, category; and 'time_dim' with columns date, month, quarter, year."

    "question": "You are given a data warehouse with a denormalized fact table 'sales_fact'. How would you denormalize this table to improve query performance for a report that aggregates sales by region and product category?",
    "answer": "To denormalize the 'sales_fact' table, you would create a new table 'region_product_category_fact' with the following columns: region_id, product_category_id, sales_amount. This table would be used for the report instead of the denormalized 'sales_fact' table, improving query performance."

The update query would be: INSERT INTO customer_dim_history (customer_id, email, effective_date) SELECT customer_id, email, CURRENT_DATE FROM customer_dim WHERE email IS NOT NULL AND email <> (SELECT email FROM customer_dim WHERE customer_id = customer_dim.customer_id AND effective_date = (SELECT MAX(effective_date) FROM customer_dim WHERE customer_id = customer_dim.customer_id));"

    "answer": "The data mart would consist of three tables: 'product_category_fact' with columns product_category_id, sales_amount, and quarter_id; 'top_selling_products_fact' with columns product_id, sales_amount, and quarter_id; and 'sales_trends_fact' with columns quarter_id, sales_amount, and product_category_id. The 'product_category_fact' table would be used for detailed sales by product category, the 'top_selling_products_fact' table for top-selling products, and the 'sales_trends_fact' table for sales trends by quarter."
