    "question": "Design a system to implement dynamic attribute-based access control (ABAC) using existing identity and access management (IAM) infrastructure. Explain how you would achieve this goal without modifying the underlying IAM system.",
    "answer": "To implement dynamic ABAC, you would need to develop an external service that interacts with the IAM system. This service would utilize API hooks or event listeners to intercept and evaluate attribute-based access requests. Based on the evaluated attributes, the service would then dynamically update the user's permissions or issue temporary access tokens, allowing for fine-grained access control without modifying the underlying IAM system."

    "question": "Suppose you're tasked with configuring a Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning system to automate user access to a cloud-based SaaS application. The system must integrate with an existing identity provider (IdP) and provide least privilege access to users upon initial login. What steps would you take to ensure secure JIT provisioning?",
    "answer": "To ensure secure JIT provisioning, you would configure the IdP to send JIT provisioning requests to the SaaS application's API upon user authentication. The SaaS application would then verify the user's identity and dynamically create a new account with minimal privileges. To further enhance security, implement rate limiting, IP address filtering, and logging to detect potential security threats."

    "question": "Describe the risks associated with using a 'break glass' or 'emergency' access account for IAM. Consider how a compromised 'break glass' account could lead to unintended consequences.",
    "answer": "Using a 'break glass' or 'emergency' access account for IAM poses significant risks, including: (1) compromised credentials providing unauthorized access to sensitive resources, (2) potential lateral movement within the organization, and (3) the inability to track and audit access granted via these accounts. In the event of a compromise, it could lead to a security incident, data breaches, or even a full-scale attack on the organization's resources."

    "question": "Design an identity federation system that integrates multiple identity providers (IdPs) to support a large enterprise with a diverse set of users and applications. Explain how you would handle conflicting attribute claims and ensure seamless user experience.",
    "answer": "To design an identity federation system, you would utilize a service federation framework such as SAML or OAuth. You would create a federation server that acts as an intermediary between the IdPs and the enterprise applications. To handle conflicting attribute claims, implement a claims transformation and mapping process to reconcile the attribute values. Additionally, use a claims aggregation strategy to combine attributes from multiple IdPs and create a unified user profile."

    "question": "Consider a scenario where a user's access credentials are compromised, and an attacker gains access to a sensitive application. Describe a post-incident response and recovery process for revoking the compromised credentials and restoring access to the user.",
    "answer": "To respond to a compromised credential incident, initiate a post-incident response and recovery process that includes: (1) immediate revocation of the compromised credentials, (2) notification of the affected user and other relevant stakeholders, (3) investigation and analysis to determine the root cause of the incident, and (4) implementation of corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future. To restore access to the user, utilize a password reset or account recovery process, and ensure that the restored credentials are unique and not previously compromised."
