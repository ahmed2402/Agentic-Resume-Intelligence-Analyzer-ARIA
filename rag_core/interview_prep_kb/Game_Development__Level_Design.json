    "answer": "A 'hub-and-spoke' level design involves creating a central hub area that players can return to, and then branching off into smaller, more focused levels or areas. This can be implemented by creating a main hub level that contains multiple portals or doors leading to different spoke levels. Each spoke level can then have its own unique design and challenges, while the hub area provides a central gathering point for the player."
