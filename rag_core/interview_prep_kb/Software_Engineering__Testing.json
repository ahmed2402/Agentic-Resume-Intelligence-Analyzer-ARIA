    "question": "You are given a function with a single argument, but no test cases cover the edge case where the argument is null. What is a simple test you could write to ensure this edge case is handled correctly?",
    "answer": "Write a test case that passes a null value to the function and verify that it handles the null input correctly."

    "question": "What is the difference between a unit test and an integration test?",
    "answer": "A unit test focuses on a single component or function, ensuring it works correctly in isolation, whereas an integration test checks how multiple components or functions work together."

    "question": "If you have a test suite that is taking too long to run, what is a common strategy to improve its performance?",
    "answer": "Run the slowest tests first and use a testing framework's built-in test filtering or skipping features to exclude slow tests during regular development cycles."

    "question": "What is a mock object in testing?",
    "answer": "A mock object is a test double that mimics the behavior of a real object without actually being the real object, used to isolate the system under test and make it easier to write focused tests."
