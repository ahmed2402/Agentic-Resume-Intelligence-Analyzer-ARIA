    "question": "A network security engineer notices that a specific IP address is sending a high volume of HTTP requests to a web server. What could be the potential threat?",
    "answer": "The potential threat is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, where the IP address is being used to overwhelm the web server with requests, causing it to become unresponsive or crash."

    "question": "Explain how machine learning-based anomaly detection can lead to false positives in threat detection, and propose a strategy to mitigate this issue.",
    "answer": "Machine learning-based anomaly detection can lead to false positives due to the difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate and malicious activities. To mitigate this issue, a strategy is to implement a hybrid approach that combines both machine learning and rule-based detection methods. This can be achieved by using machine learning models to identify potential threats and then applying rule-based detection to validate and verify the results."

    "question": "A network administrator notices that a specific IP address is accessing a large number of sensitive files. What are some potential reasons for this behavior, and how would you investigate further?",
    "answer": "Potential reasons for this behavior include insider threats, a misconfigured access control list, or a compromised account. To investigate further, I would collect network logs, analyze the access patterns, and review the access control lists. I would also conduct a thorough risk assessment to determine the potential impact of the identified behavior."

    "question": "What is the difference between a 'false positive' and a 'false negative' in threat detection, and how do they impact the overall security posture of an organization?",
    "answer": "A 'false positive' is a legitimate activity that is incorrectly identified as a threat, while a 'false negative' is a real threat that is not detected. False positives can lead to unnecessary alerts and alarms, resulting in alert fatigue and decreased effectiveness of the security team. False negatives, on the other hand, can allow real threats to go undetected, potentially leading to significant security breaches."

    "question": "Explain how behavioral analysis can be used to detect advanced persistent threats (APTs) in a network, and provide an example of a behavioral anomaly that might indicate an APT.",
    "answer": "Behavioral analysis involves monitoring and analyzing the behavior of network activity to identify patterns and anomalies. To detect APTs, I would look for behavioral anomalies such as unusual login attempts, unauthorized access to sensitive files, or unexpected changes to system configurations. For example, if a user logs in from an unusual location at an unusual time and accesses sensitive files that they do not normally interact with, this could indicate an APT."

    "question": "What are some potential evasion techniques used by advanced threats to evade detection by threat detection systems, and how can these techniques be mitigated?",
    "answer": "Potential evasion techniques include code obfuscation, encryption, and sandbox evasion. To mitigate these techniques, I would implement a multi-layered defense approach that includes sandboxing, behavioral analysis, and memory analysis. I would also stay up-to-date with the latest threat intelligence and security research to identify and counter emerging evasion techniques."
