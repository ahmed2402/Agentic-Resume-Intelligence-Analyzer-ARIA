    "answer": "Since the first qubit is in the state |0+ = (|0 + |1)/√2, the CNOT gate will apply the Pauli-X gate to the second qubit only if the first qubit is in the state |1. However, since the first qubit is in a superposition of |0 and |1, the CNOT gate will apply the Pauli-X gate to the second qubit with a probability of 50%. Therefore, the state of the system after applying the CNOT gate is (|00 + |11)/√2."

This sequence will first apply a Hadamard gate to the control qubit, then apply a rotation around the z-axis to the target qubit, then apply the CNOT gate, and finally apply the inverse of the Hadamard gate to the control qubit."

The Hadamard gate has the matrix representation H = 1/√2 \n[ 1  1 \n 1 -1]. Its adjoint is H† = 1/√2 \n[ 1  1 \n 1 -1], which is equal to its inverse, proving that it is a unitary gate."

The inner product is given by: <+, ψ| = (a+b)/√2. The probability of measuring |+ is therefore |(a+b)/√2|^2 = |a+b|^2/2 = (|a|^2 + |b|^2 + a*b* + a*b*)/2."

    "answer": "To find the state of the qubit after applying the sequence of gates, we need to apply the two gates in sequence. The rotation gate U1(2θ) will rotate the state of the qubit around the x-axis by an angle of 2θ, resulting in the state cos(2θ)|0 + sin(2θ)|1.
