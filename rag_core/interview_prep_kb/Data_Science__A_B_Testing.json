    "question": "What is the primary goal of an A/B testing experiment?",
    "answer": "The primary goal of an A/B testing experiment is to compare the performance of two or more variants of a product, feature, or process to determine which one is more effective."

    "question": "A company wants to increase the conversion rate of their website. What is the best approach to achieve this using A/B testing?",
    "answer": "The best approach is to identify the most impactful factors affecting the conversion rate, such as button color or form layout, and test different variants to determine the optimal configuration."

    "question": "How do you calculate the statistical significance of an A/B test result?",
    "answer": "You can use statistical tests such as the z-test or t-test to determine the statistical significance of the results, or use software tools that provide automatic calculation."

    "question": "Explain the concept of p-value in A/B testing and how it relates to the null hypothesis.",
    "answer": "The p-value represents the probability of observing the results of the experiment, or more extreme, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In A/B testing, the null hypothesis typically states that there is no significant difference between the treatment and control groups."

    "question": "What is the difference between a fixed effect and a random effect in a regression analysis of A/B test results?",
    "answer": "In a fixed effect model, the treatment effect is estimated as a fixed parameter. In a random effect model, the treatment effect is assumed to be randomly drawn from a larger population."

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "You are given two A/B test results with the same confidence level and sample size, but one test has a larger effect size. Which test is more statistically significant?",
    "answer": "Neither test is more statistically significant. Statistical significance is determined by the p-value, not the effect size."

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "Suppose you run an A/B test and find that the treatment group has a higher conversion rate than the control group. However, the confidence interval for the treatment effect includes zero. What can you conclude about the results?",
    "answer": "We cannot conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups. The confidence interval including zero suggests that the observed effect may be due to chance."

    "answer": "A regression-based A/B test design is suitable for estimating the lift in sales conversion due to the new marketing campaign."
