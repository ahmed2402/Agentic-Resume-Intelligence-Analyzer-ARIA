    "question": "Explain the concept of reserved instances in cloud computing and how they help with cost optimization.",
    "answer": "Reserved instances are a way to commit to using cloud resources for a specified period. They offer a discounted hourly rate compared to on-demand pricing, helping organizations save costs and budget their expenses more effectively."

    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "What is the difference between spot instances and on-demand instances in cloud computing?",
    "answer": "Spot instances are spare compute resources that are available at a discounted rate, but can be interrupted at any time. On-demand instances, on the other hand, can be started and stopped as needed, but incur higher costs."

    "topic": "Cost Optimization",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "How can organizations monitor and analyze their cloud costs to optimize their expenses?",
    "answer": "Organizations can use cloud cost management tools, such as cost allocation, tagging, and reporting, to monitor and analyze their cloud costs. These tools help identify areas of inefficiency and provide insights to optimize costs."

    "question": "Suppose you have an EC2 instance running 24/7 in AWS. What strategy would you implement to reduce costs while still maintaining availability and performance?",
    "answer": "You would implement an Auto Scaling group with Spot Instances, which allows for on-demand scaling while leveraging the cost savings of Spot Instances during periods of low demand."

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "Can you describe a scenario where using Azure Reserved Virtual Machine (VM) Instances would be more cost-effective than purchasing a VM on a pay-as-you-go basis?",
    "answer": "Reserved VM Instances would be more cost-effective when you have a consistent workload that requires a specific VM size and configuration, and you can commit to using it for at least 1 or 3 years."

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "What is the cost implication of using Persistent Disks in Google Cloud Compute Engine compared to Standard Persistent Disks?",
    "answer": "Persistent Disks are more expensive than Standard Persistent Disks, with a higher hourly pricing rate. However, Persistent Disks offer higher IOPS and lower latency, making them suitable for workloads that require high-performance storage."
