    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "What is the difference between feature extraction and fine-tuning in transfer learning?",
    "answer": "Feature extraction involves using a pre-trained model as a feature extractor, where the pre-trained model is used to extract features from input data, and a new classification layer is added on top. Fine-tuning involves retraining the pre-trained model on the target task, allowing the model to adapt to the new task."

    "answer": "Domain shift occurs when the distribution of the target domain is different from the source domain, affecting the model's performance. A method to mitigate this issue is to use domain-invariant feature learning techniques, such as adversarial training or multi-task learning, to learn features that are invariant across domains."

    "question": "Design an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of transfer learning for image classification tasks across different datasets, and discuss the results.",
    "answer": "The experiment would involve training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a pre-trained model, such as VGG16 or ResNet50, on a large dataset like ImageNet, and then fine-tuning the model on a smaller dataset like CIFAR-10 or SVHN. The results would show significant improvements in accuracy and faster convergence time for the fine-tuned model compared to training from scratch."
