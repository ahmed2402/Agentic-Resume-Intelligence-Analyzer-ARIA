    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "Explain the concept of 'toxic' alerts in monitoring and how to handle them.",
    "answer": "Toxic alerts are false positives that can lead to alert fatigue. To handle them, implement alert grouping and filtering, use machine learning-based alerting, and regularly review and update alerting rules to minimize false alarms."
