    "question": "Design a distributed file system that can handle massive scale and high availability using a cloud provider's storage services.",
    "answer": "A distributed file system can be designed using a combination of cloud provider's storage services such as Amazon S3, HDFS, and Ceph. The system would consist of a master node, multiple data nodes, and a replication mechanism. The master node would be responsible for managing metadata, while the data nodes would store the actual data. Data would be replicated across multiple nodes for redundancy and high availability. The system would use a distributed locking mechanism to ensure consistency across nodes."

    "question": "Compare and contrast the block storage services offered by Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and Azure Disk Storage.",
    "answer": "Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and Azure Disk Storage are both block storage services that provide persistent storage for virtual machines. However, they differ in their architecture and features. EBS is a block-level storage service that provides high performance and low latency, while Disk Storage is a file-level storage service that provides high capacity and low cost. EBS is optimized for high-I/O workloads, while Disk Storage is optimized for high-capacity workloads."

    "question": "Explain the concept of immutable storage and its benefits in a cloud-based storage system.",
    "answer": "Immutable storage is a storage system where data is written only once and never modified. This is achieved by creating a new version of the data whenever it is updated. Immutable storage provides several benefits, including improved data integrity, reduced data corruption, and enhanced security. It also enables versioning and auditing, making it easier to track changes to data over time."

    "question": "Describe a scenario where a company would use a cloud-based file system, such as Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), and a cloud-based object storage service, such as Amazon S3.",
    "answer": "A company that needs to store large files, such as videos and images, and requires high-performance access to these files would use a cloud-based file system, such as Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). However, for files that are accessed less frequently, such as backups and archives, a cloud-based object storage service, such as Amazon S3, would be more cost-effective. The company could use EFS for storing and serving files in real-time, while using S3 for storing and retrieving files that are accessed less frequently."
