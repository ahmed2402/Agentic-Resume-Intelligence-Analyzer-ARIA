    "answer": "The Steane code requires 7 physical qubits to encode a single logical qubit. However, to achieve a 5% error rate, you'd need to use a higher-order Steane code or a combination of codes, but even the basic implementation would require at least 7 qubits."

    "answer": "Since the code is a [3,1,3] code, it has a 3-out-of-4 syndrome decoding threshold. If a single-qubit error occurs, there's a 3/4 chance that the error will be corrected, and a 1/4 chance that it will go undetected."

If the error rate of the quantum computer is reduced to 2% after the first level of concatenation, what's the theoretical limit on the achievable error rate after the second level of concatenation?",
    "answer": "Using a concatenated code, the achievable error rate after the second level of concatenation is bounded by the square of the error rate after the first level. Therefore, the theoretical limit on the achievable error rate after the second level of concatenation would be (2%)^2 = 0.04 or 4%."
