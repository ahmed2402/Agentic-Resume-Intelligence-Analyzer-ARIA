    "question": "Explain the differences between a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) in the context of image and sequence data, respectively.",
    "answer": "A CNN is suitable for image data, where each pixel is processed by a small set of neurons to capture spatial hierarchies. In contrast, an RNN is used for sequential data, such as text or speech, where each input is processed in relation to the previous input, allowing the model to learn temporal dependencies."

    "answer": "To prevent overfitting, you can use data augmentation techniques such as random rotation, flipping, and cropping to artificially increase the size of the training dataset. Additionally, you can implement dropout regularization and use a technique called early stopping to stop the training process when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade."

    "question": "Given a neural network with multiple layers, explain how batch normalization (BN) and instance normalization (IN) differ in terms of normalization and the impact on model performance.",
    "answer": "Batch normalization normalizes the activations of each layer over the entire mini-batch, whereas instance normalization normalizes activations over a single sample. BN typically leads to faster convergence and improved stability, but can be sensitive to the choice of batch size. IN, on the other hand, can improve performance on tasks with large variations within a single sample, such as images with complex textures."

    "answer": "A possible architecture could be a CNN with two convolutional layers followed by a recurrent layer (e.g., LSTM). The CNN layers can extract spatial features from the images, while the recurrent layer can capture temporal dependencies in the handwriting patterns. This combination allows the model to learn both local and global patterns in the input data."

    "question": "Explain the concept of attention in the context of deep learning models. Provide an example of how attention can be used to improve the performance of a sequence-to-sequence model.",
    "answer": "Attention is a mechanism that allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence that are relevant to the task at hand. In a sequence-to-sequence model, attention can be used to selectively weigh the importance of different input tokens when generating the output sequence. This can be particularly useful for tasks such as machine translation, where the model needs to pay attention to specific words in the source sentence to generate accurate translations."
