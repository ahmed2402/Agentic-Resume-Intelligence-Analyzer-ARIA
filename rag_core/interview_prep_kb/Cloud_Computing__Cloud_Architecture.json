    "question": "Describe a use case for a multi-tenant architecture in a cloud-based SaaS application, considering scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness.",
    "answer": "A multi-tenant architecture is suitable for a SaaS application where multiple customers share the same instance, but with isolated resources and data. This approach allows for scalability, as resources can be dynamically allocated and deallocated based on customer demand, while maintaining security through role-based access control and encryption. It also reduces costs, as a single instance can support multiple customers, making it more cost-effective than dedicated instances per customer."
