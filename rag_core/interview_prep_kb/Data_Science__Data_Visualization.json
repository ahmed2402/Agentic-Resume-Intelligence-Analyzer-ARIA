    "question": "Design a data visualization workflow to analyze the sales of a company over time. How would you approach this task?",
    "answer": "To analyze sales over time, I would first clean and preprocess the data, then use a line chart or area chart to visualize the trends. Next, I would use a scatter plot to identify any correlations between sales and other variables such as seasonality or marketing campaigns. Finally, I would use a bar chart to compare sales across different regions or product categories."

    "question": "What is the difference between a Treemap and a Sunburst chart in data visualization? When would you use each?",
    "answer": "A Treemap is a type of rectangle-based visualization where each rectangle represents a category, and its size is proportional to the value of that category. A Sunburst chart is similar but uses a radial layout. I would use a Treemap when comparing categorical data across different levels of hierarchy, and a Sunburst chart when displaying hierarchical data in a more interactive and exploratory way."

    "question": "How would you optimize a visualization to improve its readability and effectiveness in communicating insights?",
    "answer": "To optimize a visualization, I would use color, size, and position effectively to avoid visual clutter. I would also use clear and concise labels, and limit the number of variables displayed. Additionally, I would use interactivity and animations judiciously to help users explore the data without overwhelming them."

    "question": "What is the purpose of a heat map in data visualization, and how would you use it to analyze data?",
    "answer": "A heat map is a visualization used to display the relationship between two continuous variables. It is useful for identifying clusters, correlations, and outliers in the data. I would use a heat map to analyze customer demographics, such as age and income, to identify patterns and trends that could inform marketing strategies."

    "question": "Design a data visualization system that can handle extremely large datasets and scale horizontally. How would you approach the problem and what considerations would you take?",
    "answer": "To design a data visualization system that can handle large datasets, I would consider using distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Spark or Dask. I would also use a scalable data storage solution like Apache Cassandra or Amazon S3. Additionally, I would implement a data processing pipeline that can handle data in real-time, using techniques like data streaming or batch processing. Finally, I would use a visualization library like D3.js or Matplotlib that can handle large datasets and provide interactive visualizations."

    "question": "A company has a dataset with millions of rows and multiple categorical variables. How would you perform dimensionality reduction and create a visualization that effectively communicates the insights to business stakeholders?",
    "answer": "To perform dimensionality reduction, I would use techniques like PCA or t-SNE to reduce the number of features while preserving the most important information. Then, I would use a visualization like a scatter plot or a heatmap to show the relationships between the variables. To effectively communicate the insights to business stakeholders, I would use a storytelling approach, highlighting the key findings and creating a narrative around the results."

    "answer": "To create a visualization that effectively communicates the seasonal patterns and trends, I would use a time-series visualization like a line plot or a area chart to show the overall trend. Then, I would use a technique like seasonal decomposition or a moving average to highlight the seasonal patterns. Finally, I would use a visualization like a bar chart or a heatmap to show the magnitude of the seasonal patterns and trends."
