    "question": "How do you determine the level of fidelity for a prototype, and what are the benefits of each level?",
    "answer": "The level of fidelity depends on the goals of the prototype. A low-fidelity prototype (paper sketch or wireframe) allows for quick iteration, while a high-fidelity prototype (interactive and visually appealing) provides a more accurate representation of the final product. Benefits include faster iteration and more accurate feedback."

    "question": "Describe a scenario where you would choose to use a low-fidelity prototype over a high-fidelity one, and how you would justify that decision.",
    "answer": "I would choose a low-fidelity prototype when I need to quickly test and validate assumptions about the user's workflow or to explore multiple design directions. Justifying this decision, I would point out that low-fidelity prototypes are faster to create and test, allowing for more iterations and a better understanding of the user's needs, ultimately leading to a more effective high-fidelity design."

    "question": "A user feedback session with a high-fidelity prototype revealed that users are getting confused by the numerous interactive elements on the screen. How would you address this issue?",
    "answer": "To address this issue, I would revisit the user feedback and analyze the data to identify the main pain points. Then, I would propose simplifying the design by removing or consolidating unnecessary elements, focusing on the most critical interactions and features. This would involve revising the high-fidelity prototype to better align with the user's needs and expectations."

    "question": "What are the key differences between a functional prototype and a usability prototype, and when would you choose to use each?",
    "answer": "A functional prototype is used to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a design, while a usability prototype is used to test and validate the user's experience. I would choose a functional prototype when I need to showcase the technical capabilities of a design or to test the performance of a complex system, and a usability prototype when I need to validate the user's workflow or to identify potential usability issues."

    "question": "You've been tasked with creating a prototype for a complex system that involves multiple stakeholders and requires a high degree of customizability. What approach would you take to ensure that the prototype meets the needs of all stakeholders?",
    "answer": "To ensure that the prototype meets the needs of all stakeholders, I would take a modular and iterative approach. I would break down the complex system into smaller, independent components and create a prototype for each component, using a low-fidelity approach to quickly test and validate assumptions. This would allow me to gather feedback from stakeholders and make adjustments to the prototype as needed, ultimately resulting in a high-fidelity prototype that meets the needs of all stakeholders."
