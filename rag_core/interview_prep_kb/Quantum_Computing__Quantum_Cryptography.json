    "answer": "BB84 and Ekert91 are two popular QKD protocols.

    "question": "What is the concept of the 'no-cloning theorem' in quantum cryptography, and how does it relate to secure key distribution?",
    "answer": "The no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create a perfect copy of an arbitrary quantum state. This theorem is crucial in quantum cryptography as it ensures that any attempt to eavesdrop on a quantum communication will introduce errors, making it detectable by the legitimate parties."

    "question": "Describe a scenario where a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack could potentially compromise a QKD system. How would you detect and prevent such an attack?",
    "answer": "In a QKD system, a MitM attack could occur when an attacker intercepts the quantum communication between Alice and Bob, then forwards the quantum information to the intended recipient. To detect such an attack, QKD systems often employ quantum error correction techniques and statistical analysis to identify any anomalies in the received quantum information. Prevention measures include using secure quantum channels, such as optical fibers, and implementing robust authentication protocols."

    "answer": "Entanglement swapping is a process where the entanglement between two particles is transferred to a third particle, without physically interacting with the first two particles. In quantum cryptography, entanglement swapping can be used to extend the secure key distribution to multiple parties, enabling a network of secure nodes to communicate with each other."

    "question": "Derive the BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution, and explain the principles behind it.",
    "answer": "The BB84 protocol involves the following steps: (1) Alice prepares a sequence of qubits in one of four possible basis states (0, 1, +, -). (2) Alice measures the qubits in one of the two basis states (0, 1) and sends the results to Bob. (3) Bob receives the qubits and measures them in the other basis state. (4) Alice and Bob publicly compare their measurement results to determine the correct basis for each qubit. (5) Once they agree on the correct basis, they can use the measurement results to create a shared secret key. The principles behind the protocol are based on the no-cloning theorem and the fact that a qubit can exist in a superposition of states, making it impossible to determine the correct basis without measurement."

    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "question": "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement swapping and its relation to quantum cryptography.",
    "answer": "Quantum entanglement swapping is a process where two particles become entangled, even if they have never interacted before. This process is achieved by having a third particle interact with one of the particles, causing the other particle to become entangled with it. In the context of quantum cryptography, entanglement swapping can be used to create a secure quantum channel between two parties, even if they are separated by large distances. This is achieved by using entanglement swapping to create a sequence of entangled particles, which can be used to encode and decode quantum information."

    "question": "Describe a method for detecting eavesdropping in a quantum key distribution protocol, and explain the underlying principles.",
    "answer": "One method for detecting eavesdropping in a quantum key distribution protocol is the use of a Bell-state measurement. When Alice and Bob receive their qubits, they can perform a Bell-state measurement on their qubits, which will reveal any discrepancy in the state of the qubits due to eavesdropping. The underlying principle is based on the fact that any attempt to eavesdrop on the quantum communication would introduce imperfections that would be detectable through the Bell-state measurement. If the measurement results match, it indicates that the qubits have not been tampered with, and the communication is secure."
