    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "When creating a wireframe, what is the recommended approach to labeling elements?",
    "answer": "It's recommended to use placeholder text and labels in a wireframe, rather than actual text, to avoid committing to specific content and to focus on the layout and functionality of the design."

    "question": "Describe the importance of a design system in wireframing, and how it can impact the overall user experience.",
    "answer": "A design system provides consistency and cohesion throughout the product's interface, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the product's functionality. It also enables designers to make informed decisions and iterate on the design more efficiently."

    "question": "A product has multiple features that require different layouts and interactions. How would you approach creating wireframes for these features while maintaining a consistent design language?",
    "answer": "I would start by identifying the key components and interactions for each feature, and then create a set of reusable wireframes that can be adapted to each feature. This would involve creating a modular design system that includes standardized components and layouts."

    "question": "A complex product requires wireframes that showcase multiple states (e.g. hover, active, focused). How would you create and document these states in a clear and concise manner?",
    "answer": "I would use a state diagram to visualize the different states and interactions, and then create separate wireframes for each state. I would also use notation and annotations to clearly indicate the state and any relevant interactions or behaviors."

    "question": "A product has a large dataset that needs to be presented in a concise and organized manner. How would you approach creating a data-driven wireframe that effectively communicates this information?",
    "answer": "I would start by identifying the key data points and interactions, and then create a wireframe that uses clear typography, concise labels, and intuitive navigation to present the data in a clear and organized manner. I would also consider using visualizations and charting tools to help communicate complex data insights."

    "question": "A product has multiple user personas with different needs and behaviors. How would you create wireframes that cater to these different user groups while maintaining a cohesive design language?",
    "answer": "I would start by researching and understanding the different user personas and their needs, and then create wireframes that cater to each persona's specific requirements. I would also ensure that the design language is consistent across all wireframes, using a modular design system that includes standardized components and layouts."
