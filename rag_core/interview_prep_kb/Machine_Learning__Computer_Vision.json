    "answer": "Common challenges in pedestrian detection include varying lighting conditions, occlusion, and pose variation. To address these, you could use techniques such as data augmentation with diverse lighting conditions, employ a model that can handle occlusion (e.g., using a recurrent neural network), and use a pose-agnostic detection approach (e.g., using a model that can detect pedestrians at various angles)."

    "answer": "A deep learning-based object detection model may fail to detect an object due to a 'class-agnostic' scene understanding error, where the model incorrectly identifies a part of an object as the entire object. For example, in a cluttered scene, the model may mistakenly identify a car's wheel as the entire vehicle."

    "question": "Given a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a ReLU activation function, explain why the network's output may be biased towards the negative range.",
    "answer": "The network's output may be biased towards the negative range due to the ReLU activation function's output being 0 for negative inputs and the positive input being passed through. This creates a 'dead zone' for negative inputs, resulting in a biased representation of negative values in the feature space."

    "question": "Design an approach to handle the 'occlusion problem' in 3D object recognition using a generative adversarial network (GAN).",
    "answer": "To handle the occlusion problem, we can use a GAN-based approach that generates multiple 2D views of a 3D object from different angles. The generator network generates a 3D object mesh, and the discriminator network evaluates the generated 2D views against real 2D views. This allows the model to learn the relationship between 2D views and 3D object structure, enabling it to recognize objects even when parts of them are occluded."
