    "question": "A company has a security policy that requires all employees to change their passwords every 60 days. What is a potential issue with this policy?",
    "answer": "A potential issue with this policy is that it may encourage employees to choose weak, easily guessable passwords in order to remember them, which can compromise the security of the system."

    "question": "Describe a situation where a security auditor might need to use a combination of manual and automated techniques to identify vulnerabilities in a complex system.",
    "answer": "A security auditor may need to use a combination of manual and automated techniques when auditing a complex system, such as a cloud-based infrastructure with multiple interconnected services and applications. Manual techniques, such as reviewing configuration files and interviewing personnel, can provide valuable context and identify vulnerabilities that automated tools may miss. Automated tools, such as vulnerability scanners, can quickly scan large amounts of data and identify potential vulnerabilities, but may require manual verification and analysis to determine their validity."

    "question": "A security auditor discovers a potential vulnerability in a system, but the remediation effort requires significant changes to the system's architecture. What steps should the auditor take to ensure that the changes are properly validated and tested before implementation?",
    "answer": "The security auditor should work with the system owners and developers to develop a thorough testing plan that includes both unit testing and integration testing. The plan should also include testing for any potential side effects of the changes, such as impact on system performance or user experience. Additionally, the auditor should ensure that all necessary stakeholders are informed and engaged in the remediation effort, and that any changes are properly documented and tracked throughout the process."

    "question": "How would you approach conducting a security audit of a system that uses a custom-built authentication mechanism, and what types of testing would you perform to validate the mechanism's security?",
    "answer": "To conduct a security audit of a custom-built authentication mechanism, I would start by reviewing the mechanism's design and implementation to understand its components and how they interact. I would then perform a combination of static analysis (e.g., code review) and dynamic testing (e.g., fuzz testing) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the mechanism. Additionally, I would conduct a series of attacks against the mechanism, such as password guessing and credential stuffing, to test its resistance to common attacks. Finally, I would review the mechanism's logging and audit capabilities to ensure that they are properly configured and functioning correctly."

    "question": "A security auditor identifies a potential security risk in a system, but the system owners are hesitant to implement controls to mitigate the risk due to concerns about performance or cost. How would you approach this situation?",
    "answer": "In this situation, I would work with the system owners to gather more information about the potential security risk and the concerns about implementing controls to mitigate it. I would also perform a risk assessment to determine the likelihood and potential impact of the risk, and to compare it to the potential costs and performance impacts of implementing controls. If the risk is deemed high enough, I would work with the system owners to identify alternative solutions that balance security and performance costs, such as implementing controls only for specific use cases or implementing controls that have minimal impact on system performance."

    "question": "A security auditor discovers that a system's security controls are not properly configured, resulting in a lack of visibility into system activity. What steps should the auditor take to ensure that the system's security controls are properly configured and functioning correctly?",
    "answer": "To ensure that the system's security controls are properly configured and functioning correctly, I would start by reviewing the system's security documentation and configuration files to understand the current state of the controls. I would then work with the system owners and administrators to identify the root causes of the lack of visibility and develop a plan to correct the issues. This plan would include reconfiguring the security controls to provide the necessary visibility, testing the controls to ensure they are functioning correctly, and implementing monitoring and logging to detect any future issues. Finally, I would work with the system owners to develop a process for ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the security controls to ensure they remain properly configured and functioning correctly."
