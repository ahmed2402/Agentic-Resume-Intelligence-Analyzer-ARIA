# 🤖 ARIA - Agentic Resume Intelligence Analyzer

**ARIA** is an intelligent, multi-module resume analysis system that leverages AI agents to provide comprehensive resume optimization, ATS compatibility checking, and interview preparation assistance. Built with modern AI technologies including LangChain, Groq LLM, and advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems.

## 📋 Project Abstract / Overview

ARIA (Agentic Resume Intelligence Analyzer) represents a breakthrough in AI-powered career development tools, integrating multiple specialized AI agents to create a comprehensive resume analysis and interview preparation ecosystem. The system addresses critical challenges in modern job searching by providing intelligent resume optimization, ATS compatibility analysis, and personalized interview preparation through advanced natural language processing and retrieval-augmented generation techniques.

The platform combines four distinct but interconnected modules: an intelligent resume matcher that generates tailored CVs using LLM-powered content optimization, an ATS compatibility analyzer that evaluates resume effectiveness against automated screening systems, a conversational AI assistant that provides domain-specific interview preparation through a hybrid RAG system, and a mock interview analyzer that enables users to practice answering interview questions in a realistic interview simulation environment. This multi-agent architecture enables seamless orchestration of complex document processing workflows while maintaining high accuracy and user experience standards.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The modern job market presents several critical challenges for job seekers:

1. **Resume-Job Mismatch**: Traditional resumes often fail to align with specific job requirements, leading to poor application success rates
2. **ATS Compatibility Issues**: Many qualified candidates are filtered out by Applicant Tracking Systems due to formatting or keyword optimization problems
3. **Interview Preparation Gaps**: Lack of access to comprehensive, domain-specific interview preparation resources
4. **Manual Optimization Limitations**: Human-driven resume optimization is time-consuming and often lacks the depth of AI-powered analysis
5. **Fragmented Career Tools**: Existing solutions address individual aspects of career development without providing integrated solutions

These challenges result in reduced job application success rates, increased time-to-employment, and suboptimal career progression opportunities for job seekers across various industries.

Raw Resume & JD Text ────┐
                        ↓
                ┌─────────────────────┐
                │   PDF Generator     │ ← (Blue outline)
                │   - CV creation     │
                │   - Formatting      │
                └─────────────────────┘
                        ↓
                  Tailored CV
```

**Workflow Description:**
1. **Input**: Raw resume and job description text serve as the starting point
2. **Ingestion Phase**: The Ingestion Agent processes raw data to produce cleaned, normalized text
